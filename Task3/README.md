# Conversational AI with Fine-Tuned GPT-2

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune GPT-2 for generating natural, human-like conversations between two individuals. The resulting model can be used in chatbots, virtual assistants, or any application requiring realistic conversational AI.

---

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to fine-tune OpenAI's GPT-2 model to simulate natural dialogues between two individuals. By using a structured conversational dataset, the fine-tuned model learns to respond contextually, mimicking human-like interactions.

## Features

- **Pretrained GPT-2:** Fine-tunes the GPT-2 model for dialogue generation.  
- **Customizable Prompts:** Generates conversations based on user-provided prompts.  
- **Realistic Responses:** Produces coherent, contextually appropriate answers.  
- **Scalable Model:** Compatible with different GPT-2 sizes (small, medium, large).

## Dataset

A structured dataset containing dialogues between two persons is required for fine-tuning. Each conversation should have alternating lines, such as:

```plaintext
Person1: Hello! How are you?  
Person2: I'm good, thank you! How about you?  
Person1: I'm doing well, thanks for asking.  
Person2: Glad to hear that!  
```

## Training Process

The training process involves the following steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation:**  
   Ensure the dataset is properly formatted with clearly labeled turns for each speaker.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning:**  
   - Use the Hugging Face `transformers` library for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model.  
   - Tokenize and preprocess the dataset to feed into the model.  
   - Train the model with hyperparameters optimized for conversational tasks.
